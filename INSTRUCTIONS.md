There's no assembly required with this project!

The included gcode file is for cutting the logo from 1/2 inch plywood using a 1/4 inch router bit. The file includes a lot of tabs because of the flimsy nature of the logo so it might be a hassle without a z-axis.

A MakerCAM project file is also included so that if you want to edit the thickness of the wood or the size of the bit you can easily open it in MakerCAM and adjust the paramters.
